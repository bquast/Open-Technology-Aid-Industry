\begin_layout Title
Bitcoin in the Aid Sector
\end_layout

\begin_layout Author
Bastiaan Quast
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
Anonymous online transactions through Bitcoin stand to change much in the
 both the aid sector.
 The instant and virtually free nature of Bitcoin is very enabling, which
 provides the aid sector with a powerful tool for the achievement of its
 aims.
 In this context we discuss i.a.
 remittances, mobile transactions, and barter currencies in times of financial
 crises.
 Furthermore, potential changes in the development sector itself, that we
 discuss are, traceability and anonymity of transactions via the public
 ledger system, a lower threshold to online funding, due to the pre-paid
 nature, and interactions with local governments.

\begin_layout Section
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Bitcoin is a online decentralised monetary system, which aims to cut out
 many of the middle men in the financial system, specifically governments
 and banks.
 The system is set up to be completely anonymous and decentralised, it originate
s from a white paper "Bitcoin: A peer-to-peer electronic cash system" published
 under the pseudonym

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This article focuses on potential uses of Bitcoin in development and the
 aid industry, a discussion of the merit of the existence of the Bitcoin
 system is outside the scope of this article, we observe that for better
 or worse, the system now exists and will exist, although Bitcoin might
 be overtaken by even other systems, for the purposes of this article, we
 are primarily concerned with the fact that an anonymous internet-based
 transaction mechanism exists.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The ownership of bitcoins is registered in the public ledger called the
 blockchain, and can be proven by publishing a signature online, using a
 secret key.
 This means that transactions can be conducted from any computer or smartphone
 with internet access without a third party being needed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are many uses for a monetary system of this type, in this article
 we will focus on the uses particular to the aid sector.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the next section, we discuss the mechanics behind the Bitcoin system
 in some more detail, with examples specific to development, as well the
 value of Bitcoin.
 Subsequently, we list some of the key potential uses of Bitcoin in the
 development.
 In section four we discuss some new possibility for the aid sector in particula
r.
 We conclude with a discussion on the key challenges for widespread use
 of bitcoin in development and some recent innovations with potential uses
 in the development sector.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
How does Bitcoin work?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Bitcoin was created in an attempt to solve the problem of online anonymous
 transactions in a decentralised system.
 This required addressing several previously unsolved problems.
 Bitcoin introduces several technological innovations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The core part of the Bitcoin system is the public ledger called the blockchain,
 it contains all transactions in the history of the Bitcoin system.
 However, since the system was designed to be decentralised, there is not
 one primary version, in fact there are millions of identical copies called
 nodes.
 Decisions are based on a consensus of the nodes, which means that the majority
 determines which transactions are valid.
 This prevents individuals from meddling with the ledger.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The software that users have on their computer, phone, or online, is set
 over several keys.
 Most importantly, the private key, possession of this number constitutes
 ownership of the wallet.
 Using the private key, two things can be created, Bitcoin addresses, on
 which, bitcoins can be deposited, and digital signatures, which can be
 used to send Bitcoins from these addresses.
 A typical process would be as follows.
 A user downloads the Bitcoin software on his computer or smartphone.
 Using the software, a new private key is generated.
 Using the private key, a set of Bitcoin addresses is created.
 The users receives a Bitcoin payment in one of these addresses, in return
 for e.g.
 goods sold.
 The user now purchases something with Bitcoin.
 Using the software, a transaction from the Bitcoin address which received
 the Bitcoin is created and published to the Bitcoin network, in combination
 with a signature, which is also generated from the private key.
 The Bitcoin network receives the transaction request, using a mathematical
 procedure, the signature is verified to belong to the address containing
 the Bitcoins (this is proves that the signer owns the private key which
 belongs to the address and can be done by the network without knowing this
 private key).
 The transaction is then accepted at which point it simultaneously is committed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is useful at this point to make the distinction between Bitcoin (capital
 B), which is the entire system, and bitcoin (miniscule b), which is the
 dominant unit of account, similar to a Swiss franc or a euro.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Bitcoin Value
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the context of Bitcoin, the discussion of where it values derives from
 and the fact that is it not legal tender.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The discussion on it value is a complicated one, outside of the scope of
 this article.
 We will however make two observations:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Bitcoin has sustained a positive and large value over a sustained period
 of time
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Most transaction unites in monetary systems, have no intrinsic value, fiat
 currencies, but even gold has very little
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For a further discussion of Bitcoin and its value see

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The issue of legal tender is quite different.
 Legal tender essentially means a state imposing a method of transaction
 (that it controls) within its territory.
 This has the positive effect that it unifies accounting.
 However, if the state does not manage the currency in a credible fashion,
 then this will lead to hyperinflation.
 This in term will lead to capital flight.
 A recent and reoccurring example in Argentina, which, at the time of writing,
 taxes all foreign credit card purchases with an additional 35%.
 By having a system without a single owner, this is rendered impossible.
 The Argentinian case further illustrate how Bitcoin can be used in times
 of economic crisis.
 During each of the currency crises that hit Argentina during the last decades,
 barter currencies arose.
 These provide a more stable means of holding value than government sanctioned
 money.
 By having a barter currency with a value outside the country (which can
 be quoted in US dollar), additional stability can be added.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this section we will discuss how Bitcoin relates specifically to the
 aid sector, there are a few aspects of particular interest to the aid sector.
 Firstly, there is the instant nature of the transactions, and how this
 can help in possible disbursement problems.
 Secondly, traceability and anonymity of the transactions and how this relates
 to partnerships with local governments.
 Thirdly, in relation to local governments, there is the issue of not using
 the local currency, which is legal tender, which can be problematic if
 government disagree with this practice, but in situations where there is
 no cooperation it can also be beneficial, such as Argentina or Zimbabwe.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Firstly, as noted above, the flow of Bitcoins can always be tracked, from
 one Bitcoin address to the next, and so on.
 However, these addresses are anonymous, since ownership is proven only
 by knowledge of the private key.
 This thus opens the possiblity of providing financial support to groups
 who face government procecution.
 This could be women's rights groups in Saudi-Arabia or LGBT groups in Russia.
 This is anonymous to both the sender and the receiver.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The second aspect of Bitcoin which is particularly relevant is the nature
 of the transactions.
 All transactions are public, as they are recorded in the public ledger.
 This makes it possible to see where bitcoins go after they are sent to
 a certain address.
 Traceability with local partner agreement, can be a condition for future
 cooperation.
 The optional message.
 Without local cooperation, the flow of Bitcoins can still be traced but
 it will not longer be possible to link addresses to individuals or organisation
s.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Crowdfunding and Bitcoin
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A further recent innovation in the finance industry is crowdfunding.
 In a crowdfunding campaign an idea is described and the public is asked
 to 'donate' an amount in order to fund the realisation.
 Depending on the amount 'donated' this can unlock certain perks, such as:
 a thank you on social media, or a physical or digital copy of the final
 product, such as a video game or, a smartwatch (Pebble).
 Many of these campaigns have goals that involve social development, such
 as the Keepod campaign.
 Which aimed to create USB key which contains an operating system that can
 be loaded direct from the USB key, so that people who do not own a computer
 can run their own system on any computer.
 Contributors in this campaign could donate money, for each key that was
 ordered, an additional key was given to slum dwellers in Nairobi.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Generally these campaigns are organised through established platforms such
 a Kickstarter of Indiegogo.
 There are several reasons for this, firstly, payment if often via creditcard,
 which means that the institution has to be trustworthy.
 Since Bitcoin operate on a sort of pre-paid model, such as PayPal, it enables
 the customer to contribute without surrendering sensible information.
 A good example of a crowdfunding initiative that uses Bitcoin, is called
 "Bitcoin against Ebola", which provides books and lunches for children
 living in affected areas.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A variation on crowdfunding is the relatively recent phenomenon of internet
 tipping, like it's physical world counterpart, a good dead, idea, or comment
 is rewarded (after the fact) with a tip.
 By operating on a pre-paid model, tips can be given to total strangers,
 who otherwise would perhaps not be trusted with this kind sensible information.
